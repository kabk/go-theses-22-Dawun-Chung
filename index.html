	<p><span class="underline">Abstract</span><br> 
Korea was highly effected and destroyed through the Japanese occupation and both the aftermath of this colonial era and the Korean War. After the war, South Korean(The Republic of Korea) government implemented a modernization project to modernize the country and implement radical policies, dreaming of unification as a means of surviving as a now divided country. At that time, the president, Park Chung-hee expected unification to be in modernization. The road to modernization was economic independence and independence was the first step to unification. He pursued the national reconstruction project with the goal of "relieving the backward country by securing the legitimacy of the development dictatorship through modernization." Therefore, modernization and dictatorship in Korea are closely related.</p><p>
Because of these backgrounds, Korea in the 1970s was a rapidly industrializing country that could not be found before. In order to achieve their goals, they carried out a result-oriented policies and a showing-off(red tape) policies (also for showing to developed countries, including North Korea). It relates to the establishment of a factory culture(fast-fast culture) represented by productivity and economy. The factory culture affects the entire society at a very rapid rate. Because there was not enough time for new cultural and social values to be localized, the cultural and social characteristics of South Korea were strangely twisted for a short time, and as a result, people's perceptions were greatly affected. And while society is rapidly changing like this, industrialization, modernization are used as a tool for South Korean government to exercise social control.</p>
	<p>In this thesis, I investigate the social and cultural background that led to the emergence of factory culture(fast-fast culture) and talk about how that culture influenced people consciously and unconsciously as propaganda to the Korean government.</p><br>


	<p><span class="underline">Introduction</span><br>
Last summer, while eating in a Korean restaurant, I felt awkward. The space was open so that one could see it at one glance, and white neon lights were installed at the high ceiling. The clerks were sweating and busy, and the customers were eating ‘hard’ and quick. More, the owner of the place was watching all of this from the counter at the entrance. I suddenly had a deep impression of being inside a certain type of factory, a food factory, and I was one essential part of it.
</p>

	<p>In my thesis, I investigate whether fast-fast culture(빨리빨리 문화) can be explained with the term “clarity”, which actually exists in Korean society, then insert that word here please in Korean, and if so, why it was formed, and how we are influenced by the visual environment that surrounds us by looking at the phenomenon.<label for="sn-by-looking-at-the-phenomenon" class="margin-toggle footnote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-by-looking-at-the-phenomenon" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="footnote">1. In here, fast-fast culture(빨리빨리 문화) refers to a perception that prioritizes improving productivity through competition and thereby maximizing efficiency.</span></p>

	<p>Korea was highly effected and destroyed through the Japanese occupation and both the aftermath of this colonial era and the Korean War. After the war, the Korean government implemented a modernization project to modernize the country and implement radical policies, dreaming of unification as a means of surviving as a now divided country. At that time, the president, Park Chung-hee expected unification to be in modernization. The road to modernization was economic independence and independence was the first step to unification. He pursued the national reconstruction project with the goal of “relieving the backward country by securing the legitimacy of the development dictatorship through modernization.” Therefore, modernization and dictatorship in Korea are closely related.</p><br>

	<p><span class="underline">First Chapter. Clarity as artificial light in factory</span><br>
In Korea, competition, productivity, efficiency, etc. have become the most important keywords to achieve modernization, and among the existing cultural styles, things that do not correspond to these, i.e., unreasonable, non - objective, and hard to measure (In the western perspective), they were considered to be obsolete relics, shameful things, or superstitions that should be erased or hidden. Because it was a nation-led development under the dictatorship, it was decided in a short period of time by the government’s judgment rather than through various discussions and social consensus. As a result, clarity has become the most important value.></p>
	

	<p><span class="underline">The role of factories in Korea's modernization</span><br>
From the point of view of a modernized country, a factory is not only a production facility that produces goods, but it is also the most important facility for advancing to a developed country, and it is an important means of producing a developed national image by notifying the international community of one’s technological capabilities.4 It should be recognized as a developed country or a country with development potential. This is because Korea can receive investment from foreign companies or borrow loans from other countries. Factories played a very important role as a driving force in Korea’s modernization.<span class="footnotenumber">2 3</span></p>

	<p>The role of artificial lights in factories
One of the most important factors in maintaining and operating a plant was electricity. Excluding raw materials for mass production of goods, it was important to expand electrical facilities to run machines in order to process and manufacture goods.<span class="footnotenumber">4</span>  Korea's first nuclear power plant, completed in 1978, was the 21st in the world at the time, and it was the largest investment project in Korea's construction history at the time. Since then, Korea currently has 24 nuclear power plants, which ranks sixth in the world.<span class="footnotenumber">5</span> The most intuitive element to view electricity is lighting. Since the role of lighting in a factory is a matter directly related to work safety, a stable supply of electricity is an issue that is linked to worker safety, productivity, efficiency, and clarity.
</p>




	<!-- 통째로 들여쓰기 필요 -->
	<p>“Of the various factory services which may contribute to the welfare and safety of occupants of workplaces, lighting is of high importance. A report of a five-year study by the Accident Prevention Advisory Unit of the Health and Safety Executive (UK) says that the most safety-conscious companies are those which tend to be commercially successful”<span class="footnotenumber">6</span></p>


	<p>Lighting isn't just for safety.</p>

	<!-- 통째로 들여쓰기 필요 -->
	<p>“Imagine you are a young person entering a school. This may be the series of events that unfolds: even before entering, you may be recorded by surveillance cameras that have the ability to zoom in and archive the footage that is taken; you may be required to scan an ID card that retrieves information about you and is able to track your whereabouts through a radio-frequency identification (RFID) system; you may pass through an upright metal detector; or have your body scanned, perhaps your face, iris, or palm, by a device that checks your biometric reading against a database of collected readings. […] The fortification of schools is primarily a business response to safety. Safety has become a commodity that is sold by security professionals whose purpose, after all, is to make money and to create profit for the security companies for which they work.While we may hear that security equipment is used in order to create a “safe environment” or, on the other hand, for “social control,” these claims miss a significant aspect of school fortification: that the installation of security equipment in schools is foremost a corporate transaction led not by people who can guarantee us safety, and not by tyrants imposing social control, but rather by business people who convince us that products they have for sale will give us peace of mind.”<span class="footnotenumber">7</span> </p>


	

	<p>Just like the Korean government that justified its dictatorship under the pretext of economic development, many factories, schools, hospitals, and prisons with similar characteristics installed lights and constructed an environment adapted to monitor citizens and workers, an environment that could be monitored as such. A common argument to justify these measures was the safety aspect  The idea seems to be where there is light there is no crime.</p>

	<p>Artificial light in another sense is a symbol of urbanization and modernization. Still, satellite images taken by NASA are often used as a means of making dramatic comparisons between North and South Korea. Fig1. If you look at the photo, you can see that Korea is generally shining around major cities. On the other hand, most of North Korea's territory except Pyongyang is shrouded in darkness. It is used as an image that intuitively represents poverty in North Korea. As such, artificial lighting is still playing a role as a measure of the industrialization and urbanization of a country. </p>


	<p>Second Chapter. Clarity as material
In the 1970s, Korea went through industrialization and modernization, and changes occurred in the materials mainly used. From small objects such as spoons to huge structures.
</p>

	<p>Changes in kitchenware material
Traditionally, Korea, like other Asian countries, used wood material most frequently. Not only because it is easily available, but also because it is cheap. So, from tableware to building materials, most of them were made of wood or soil. Metal materials are expensive and difficult to obtain, and processing is also difficult compared to wood, so it was not suitable for general use by ordinary people. Although it was difficult for ordinary people to use, not all of them did not use metal-based household items. Korean royalty and nobility were often threatened with assassination. One of the types of assassination was lethal feeding. Poison intake is mostly mixed with food during meals. The royal family devised several methods to prevent death from poisoning. First, the maid had to taste the food to be served on the table in advance, and second, silver or brass tableware was used. Most of the poisons used at that time discolor silver due to chemical reactions when it comes into contact with the silver. It could determine whether food is poisonous or not through the discoloration of tableware.<span class="footnotenumber">8</span>  Silver and brass tableware became symbols of kitchenware used by the Korean royal family from 18B.C (Baekje Kingdom). The nobility and the rich also began to use metal tableware to show off their wealth.
</p>

	<p>Although the beginnings of metal kitchenware were silver and brass, the common people could not use such expensive materials. After Korea's industrialization, stainless steel tableware, a similar material, became popular in Korea because even the poorer population could use it without burden due to its low price. It is sturdy and clean to use. And it shone brightly. Spoons, chopsticks, water cups, soup bowls, and dinner plates were quickly replaced with stainless steel products, and Korea began to sparkle all over the place.</p>

	<p> The position of iron in Korea's industrialization process
This can be seen as reflecting not only the convenience of the material, but also the symbolism of the material and the appearance of praising the metal and it can be further interpreted as being used as a propaganda tool. To find out more about this, it is necessary to talk about how important the development of heavy industry is in Korean society and how it was used for social control. First, Take a look at the video ‘Life of young Koreans in their 20s developing with the First and Second Five-Year Economic Development Plan’ produced in 1968 by the Korean National Film Production.<span class="footnotenumber">9</span>Fig1, 2.</p>

	<p>In the video, one sees a woman working in a textile factory, she is operating a hydroelectric power plant, red molten iron is flowing from a furnace, and a factory worker is sweating while constructing a building or making a car are repeatedly shown. Smoke is constantly coming out of the chimneys of factories built of cement. A nuclear power plant is under construction. The camera traverses the beautifully manicured park and shows a harmonious family enjoying shopping in a department store, pulling a shopping cart. Students paint on canvas a university building that is just over ten years old, “designed in the neo-classical style with ancient Greek columns and triangular gable walls.” Students lie on the grass in the garden and read books, and research is conducted in the science lab. Girls practice ballet as a group, and boys practice taekwondo.<span class="footnotenumber">10</span></p>

	<p>Through this video produced by the Korean government, we can guess the ideal Korean society that the Korean government wanted at the time. The number of scenes related to heavy industry appearing in this propaganda video is an important indicator that can infer how the Korean government was treating heavy industry at the time. By inserting and juxtaposing the image of a heavy industry factory among the images that accepted advanced culture (Ballet, department store, students practicing Western painting at a university built in a Western-style building style, laboratory research), It creates a visual language of Heavy industry as ‘Korea’s future’</p>

	<p>The relationship between South Korea's industrialization and defense products
	Modern propaganda used in South Korea in the 1960s and 1970s did not mean that North Korea should be annihilated by force.<span class="footnotenumber">11</span> The way Korea pursued was to achieve modernization through national industrialization and to make the country wealthy, thereby securing systemic superiority. Because Korea relied on the United States for most of its defense power. Also South Korea's wartime operational control was with the United States, it was difficult to overthrow North Korea by force. Also, right after division, from 1950 to the early 1970s, North Korea had superior economic and national defense power over South Korea, so South Korea's top priority was to develop national defense and economic power in order to prove its ideological superiority.<span class="footnotenumber">12</span> There were several reasons behind that goal. First, in the 1970s, the United States reduced military aid and even the size of the US Forces Korea decreased.<span class="footnotenumber">13</span> Korea, which has relied on the US military for its defense, needs more independent defense than ever. Second, in 1968, North Korean special forces agents infiltrated South Korea, and there were a shooting and grenade detonation in Seoul. Since then, North Korea has continued to threaten South Korea. Korea's heavy and chemical industry, which had to continuously manage such real threats, even though Korea was a ceasefire country, developed in close relationship with weapons development. Nuclear power plants were involved in the development of nuclear weapons, and private factories were involved in the manufacture of weapons in case of emergency. In Korea, developed on the basis of this, the defense industry leads to arms exports. In 2019, South Korea ranked eighth among the world's arms export countries.<span class="footnotenumber">14</span></p>
